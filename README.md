# Generate-Password
For this assignment I built out the necessary code to generate passwords of any given variety of Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.  I generated the prompts to ask the user what their password criteria preference is and built the logic out from those responses.  This was the long form of acheiving the password, there is most likely a more truncated version of how to process that information.
